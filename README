Build Process
=============
Traditionally, you converted your LaTeX source file to a DVI file, which could
then be  converted to PostScript with dvips.  This, in turn, can be converted
to a PDF file by ps2pdf:

		  latex		    dvips	     ps2pdf
	text.tex -------> text.dvi -------> text.ps --------> text.pdf

This requires all the graphics to be EPS files. But that's not a major problem,
as raster graphics can be converted to EPS.  Furthermore, the scalability of
vector graphics means clean-looking figures at all resolutions.  And vector PS
is usually very compact.

But what about using photographs, which are usually saved as JPEGs?  This
really isn't a problem, because the jpeg2ps command (from Debian's jpeg2ps
package) wraps JPEG images in an EPS header.

build.xml
  Ant build.xml to compile LaTeX file crafted by Jason Kattell at

  abstract.  Cool stuff.

  Analogous to 'make clean' target.
